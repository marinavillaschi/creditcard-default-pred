## Project Description

This project is a ML approach to predict credit card client default.

Client default is a great challenge finance institutions face that can cause great loss. Being able to predict it is important so companies can save and avoid losses.

Financial institutions are increasing their investment in AI and ML with the purpose of predicting default and as a result minimizing it.


## Results

The entire process is detailed and coded in the notebooks: [PT](https://github.com/marinavillaschi/creditcard-default-pred/blob/main/Previsão_de_Inadimplência_de_Cartão_de_Crédito.ipynb) or [EN](https://github.com/marinavillaschi/creditcard-default-pred/blob/main/Credit_Card_Default_Prediction.ipynb)

Also, a blog post of the findings is available [here](https://pandascouple.medium.com/previs%C3%A3o-de-inadimpl%C3%AAncia-544e5a2ffced).
